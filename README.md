Recommendation;

1.	Yearly rotation/transfer of salespersons to different regions will help to improve / boost the sales in the different regions.
2.	Organize meetings with the sales team to identify the potential reason for the drop in revenue from July to September, also the reasons for the significant increase in revenue for the month of June, October and December, and also to identify way to boost sales especially in the west region. 
3.	Gather customers feedback as to why they are not buying certain products, and also to know preferred products being purchased especially in the west since it has the lowest sum of revenue generated. This will help us target the right audience with the right products.
